# HueeyðŸŒž
I'm from Singapore. I enjoy playing with datasets to create insightful data story-telling **dashboard visualisations** using Tableau / Power BI. 

## Skills and Experiences
ðŸ’» ðŸ›  : TABLEAU / POWER-BI / SQL / HTML


#### Examples of Demo
 <table width="500">
  <tr>
        <td>
<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cupcorn8676/viz/RetailDashboard_16931087792260/Dashboard1" target="_blank"><img src= "https://github.com/hueeylow/hueey_profile/blob/main/DB_snapshot_interactive.gif" width="280"/> </a></td>
    <td>The illustrated demo was built upon using customer shopping dataset. The YoY metrics and insightful charts were built to provide quick visibility into overall sales performance that would benefit the management, sales & marketing teams in better understand each product category,  sales traction of retail malls, consumers spending as well as to leverage on these data points to make informed decisions and strategies.<br> <br>
