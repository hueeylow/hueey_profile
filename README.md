I'm from Singapore. I enjoy playing with datasets to create insightful data story-telling **dashboard visualisations** using Tableau / Power BI. 

## Skills and Experiences

#### Project Demo

    <td><b>Data Visualisation using Tableau </b><br><br>The illustrated demo was built upon using customer shopping dataset. The YoY metrics and insightful charts were built to provide quick visibility into overall sales performance that would benefit the management, sales & marketing teams in better understand each product category,  sales traction of retail malls, consumers spending as well as to leverage on these data points to make informed decisions and strategies.

    <td> <b>Building SQL Database </b><br><br>The built-from-scratch database was inspired by Housing Built-To-Order idea as chosen demo. The illustration highlighted the importance of creating good data table structures to optimise data storage space and also for data security access reason. Having well structured dataset make it functionable for other form of use, i.e. query results from ready UI, building of dashboards.
