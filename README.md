## About Me
Hello there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio. Iâ€™m based in Singapore. My background is in Tech and Finance. I enjoy creating engaging projects demo, utilising a variety of tools such as Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python.  Whether it's building interactive visualisations, analysing complex datasets, or developing data-driven solutions, I enjoy combining these technologies to effectively showcase my concepts and ideas. 

Feel free to add me on LinkedIn to stay connected and explore more of my work.
