## About Me
Hello there! Thanks for visiting my portfolio. Iâ€™m based in Singapore. My background is in Tech and Finance. I enjoy creating engaging projects demo, utilising a variety of tools such as Tableau, Power BI, SQL and Python.  Whether it's building interactive visualisations, analysing complex datasets, or developing data-driven solutions, I enjoy combining these technologies to effectively showcase my concepts and ideas. 

Feel free to add me on LinkedIn to stay connected and view more of my work.

Some key features of the dashboard are â€“ Test Execution Status, Performance Metrics, User Story Points Coverage, Defect metrics. The primary users are testers, developers, product owners, and business analysts who will leverage the dashboard to track testing progress, monitor defect status and prioritise issues. The dataset utilises self-populated data that mirror the likely challenges encountered in product development. </td>
