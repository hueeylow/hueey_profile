The YoY metrics and insightful charts were built to provide quick visibility into overall sales performance that would benefit the management, sales & marketing teams in better understand each product category,  sales traction of retail malls, consumers spending as well as to leverage on these data points to make informed decisions and strategies  </td>

The approach was to identify key operational issues through drawing insights from  the performance data and propose recommmendations to address the underlying issues that resulted high incident rates.

     <td><b> <a href="https://github.com/hueeylow/SQL/blob/main/SQL_Demo.md" target="_blank">Building SQL Database - Housing Built-To-Order Database </a> </b><br><br>The built-from-scratch database was inspired by Housing Built-To-Order idea as chosen demo. The illustration highlighted the importance of creating good data table structures to optimise data storage space and also for data security access reason. Having well structured dataset make it functionable for other form of use, i.e. query results from ready UI, building of dashboards.</td>

Hence, I kickstarted a BMI indicator project to gauge one's health status. </td>
