# HueeyðŸŒž
I'm from Singapore. I enjoy playing with datasets to create insightful data story-telling **dashboard visualisations** using Tableau / Power BI. 

## Skills and Experiences
ðŸ’» ðŸ›  : TABLEAU / POWER-BI / SQL / HTML


#### Examples of Demo
 <table>
  <tr>
        <td>
<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cupcorn8676/viz/RetailDashboard_16931087792260/Dashboard1" target="_blank"><img src= "https://github.com/hueeylow/hueey_profile/blob/main/DB_snapshot_interactive.gif" width="280"/> </a></td>
    <td>The illustrated demo was built upon using customer shopping dataset. The YoY metrics and insightful charts were developed to show quick visuality of the sales performance that would benefit the management, sales & marketing teams to better understand the performance of each product category,  sales traction of retail malls, consumers spending as well as to leverage on these data points to derive business decisions, improve consumers' shopping experience. <br> <br>
